# PIMPNet3D
We present Patch-based Intuitive Multimodal Prototypes Network (PIMPNet), an interpretable multimodal model for 3D images and demographics applied to the binary classification of Alzheimer's Disease from 3D structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI, T1-MRI) and patient’s age.

Classes (clinical cognitive decline level):

- Cognitively Normal (CN)
- Alzheimer's Disease (AD)

Presented as _late-breaking work_ during the [The 2nd World Conference on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence](https://xaiworldconference.com/2024/the-conference/) in July 2024.

![Overview of PIMPNet](https://github.com/desantilisa/PIMPNet3D/blob/main/pimpnet_poster.png)   

Images, ages and labels (cognitive decline level) were collected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) https://adni.loni.usc.edu (data publicitly available under request)

Codes adapted from the original [PIPNet](https://github.com/M-Nauta/PIPNet/tree/main)
